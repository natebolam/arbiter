//! This module contains the [`Fork`] struct which is used to store the data
//! that will be loaded into an [`Environment`] and be used in `arbiter-core`.
//! [`Fork`] contains a [`CacheDB`] and [`ContractMetadata`] so
//! that the [`Environment`] can be initialized with a forked database and the
//! end-user still has access to the relevant metadata.
