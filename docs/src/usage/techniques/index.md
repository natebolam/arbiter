# Techniques

At a high level when you are designing a simulation the two things you need to think about are behaviors and one or more random variable. 
A random variable is what you can perturb over the course of a simulation.
For example almost all economic models have a random variable that represents the price.
This allows you to see how the model behaves under different prices or market conditions.
Does this system handle price volatility well?
Or does it break down?
