## Vulnerability Corpus
If you have found a vulnerability in a smart contract using Arbiter, please report it to us by opening an issue on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/primitivefinance/arbiter/issues) page or consider adding it yourself to our [Vulnerability Corpus](./vulnerability_corpus.md).
This can help the Ethereum developer community know how to test their own smart contracts and avoid similar vulnerabilities.
